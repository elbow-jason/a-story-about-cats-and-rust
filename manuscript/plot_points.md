Wildman gets involved in programming:

+ Wildman randomly catches a cricket in his discovery of Python programming language.
+ Wildman somehow finds out about github.
+ He loves the cat icon.
+ He wants to figure out what to do next.
+ Wildman learns a little about Rust and looks up some videos.
+ Wildman finds talks by Steveklabnik. Wildman likes Steve's voice and decides that Rust is the next thing he will have fun with base only on the liking of steveklabnik's voice.

+ Wildman writes some rust code, but can't compile because he has not installed the rust compiler.
+ He installs the Rust compiler with cargo.

+ He attempts to run the code and It fails?

+ His thought becomes tests for the code?

+ He runs the code and notices how fast is ran. FAST.
+ He tells Ruby about "the Rust" in his own natural voice. The cats now have voices.
