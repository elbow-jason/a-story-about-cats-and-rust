# Chapter 1

The topic about which this book was written is not the Rust Programming Language. This book is about "cats". Everything in this book is literal. There are no analogies. There are no metaphors. This is not fiction. This is a true story about "cats".

Our story begins in the summer of 2014 when two "cats", Ruby and Wildman, came into existence though they may have actually been here all along. Ruby, a female, is a lovely color/colour gray/grey (A for Americans and E for Everyone Else) with a slightly visible striping pattern with gray/grey eyes. Wildman is a beautiful, sleek black with green eyes.
You, the reader, may have noticed that the word "cats" has double quotes around it. These are in fact shudder quotes and they denote skepticism of the quoted term cats. The significance of the implication that these "cats" are not what they seem. The "cats" are not cats. While reading this book (Is this a book yet?) there will be many cases of things not being what they seem, but rest assured that anything that is called a cat is most likely just some dangerous entity with claws.
