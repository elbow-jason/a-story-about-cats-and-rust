Amazingly, they are able to do this through manipulation of the command-line of the boy's computer. In the command line one of the cats, Wildman if I had to gander a guess, entered:

In the real world, the previous command was downloading and installing the Rust compiler called via ```$ rustc --help``` and Rust's package manager, cargo called via ```$ cargo --help```.
